# Eco-Movement-Project
R Programming, EDA, 3 Factor Classification and Modeling

Eco-Movement is the independent provider of  location data of charge points. They are specialised in the aggregation, cleaning and enriching of dynamic charge point location data. 
I was given multiple datasets from different countries and I had to merge the datasets, clean them and create accurate models to predict if a charger is public, private or company.
Since the data is confidential, I can not share them. I am sharing some of my codes just for my GitHub profile and removing crucial points that might cause any violation.
